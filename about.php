<h2 class="a-mh">About BabySafe</h2>
<div class="abt-container">
    <p class="p">
        BabySafe was founded with a simple mission: to make finding trusted childcare easier and safer for families everywhere. We understand that choosing someone to care for your children is one of the most important decisions you'll make as a parent.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        That's why we've built a platform that connects families with thoroughly vetted, experienced babysitters in their local communities. Every sitter on our platform undergoes a comprehensive background check, certification verification, and interview process before they can accept bookings.
